5. Understanding this phylogeny helps track antibiotic resistance, study pathogen evolution, and improve public health responses. Scientists can identify bacterial strains with resistance genes by analyzing genetic relationships, tracing disease origins, and predicting future outbreaks. It also helps with mutations that increase virulence or transmissibility, guiding the development of targeted treatments and vaccines. Ultimately, this information supports better surveillance, containment strategies, and medical advancements to combat emerging health threats.
